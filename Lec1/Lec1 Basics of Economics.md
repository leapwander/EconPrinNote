# Basics of Economics

## Part I
**Economics, Scarcity, Opportunity Cost, Trade-off**

`Economics` is a choise we make out of the limited resource to satisfy our desire as much as possible.

`Scarcity` : The imbalance between human desire and resource available.

`Opportunity Cost` : The highest valued alternative you would have to give up to engage in that activity.

`Trade-Off` : With limited resource available producing/consuming more of one good or service means producing/ consuming less of another good or service.

> 机会成本：强调替代方案。<br>
> 权衡：强调一种此消彼长。<br>

## Part II

`Margin` : The next or extra unit.

> 边际：理解成求导就行，关注其经济学意义。

`Marginal Benefit` : `MB`for short - An increase(or decrease) in total benefit that is caused by a unit increase in the level of that activity, all other factors remaining constant.

`Marginal Cost` : `MC`for short - An increase(or decrease) in total cost that is caused by a unit increase in the level of that activity, all other factors remaining constant.

`Net Gain` = `MB` - `MC`

> 净收益：边际收益减去边际成本。

`Rational Behavior`: keep consuming as long as `MB` > `MC`.
