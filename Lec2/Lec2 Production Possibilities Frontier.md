# Production Possibilities Frontier

## Part I

`Production`:
- Inputs: Labor, Capital, Nature Resource, Enterpreneurship
- Production: Technology
- Outputs: Goods, Services

**Assumptions**:
- Fixed quantity and quality of natural resources
- Technology is given
- Some inputs are specialized
- Only two outputs

## Part II

`Production Possibilities Frontier`: `PPF` for short - A curve showing the maximum attainable combinations of two products that may be produced with available resources and current technology.

> 生产可能性边界：两种商品、最大组合

If we achieve `productive efficiency`, then in a given period, when resources and technology are fixed, we can obtain **more** of one item only by **sacrificing** the opportunity to produce alternative items.

> 生产效率：只能通过牺牲其他产品的生产机会来获取某产品。

`Law of Increasing Cost`: For a given period, the opportunity cost of each additional unit of output for one good will increase as more of that is produced, because resource are specialized. <br>
$\Rightarrow$ determines the shape of `PPF`.

> 机会成本随着某产品的生产数量的增加而增加。<br>
> 所以`PPF`是上凸的。

## Part III

`Economic Growth`: An increase in production possibility.

**Source of Economic Growth**:
- Resource Growth
- Improvements in Resource Quality
- Advances in Technology <br>

$\rightarrow$ Investment in new capital, education, and technology is the major determinat of economic growth. <br>
Making investments for the future generally requires the sacrifice of current consumption. <br>
The greater a nation's rate of investment, the greater its rate of economic growth.

## Part IV

**Shifts in the PPF**

**Overall Economic Growth** - The `PPF` will shift out.

**One Sector Economic Growth** - One end of the `PPF` will shift out.
