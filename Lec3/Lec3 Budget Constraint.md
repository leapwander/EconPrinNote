# Budget Constraint

> 预算约束

## Part I

`Budget` - Constraints that consumers face as a result of limited income. Determined by 
- Income: expenditure can't exceed income unless we borrow.
- Prices: the prices of what we want.

$$p_x \cdot x + p_y \cdot y \leq M$$
$$P_x \cdot Q_x + P_y \cdot Q_y \leq M$$

> $P_x \cdot Q_x + P_y \cdot Q_y$是总开销，$P$代表价格，$Q$代表数量。

`Budget Constraint`: also called `Budget Line` - All feasible combinations of good for which the total amount of money spent is equal to income.
$$p_x \cdot x + p_y \cdot y = M$$

Budget line is the boundary between affordable and unaffordable combinations of items.
$$ \text{Expenditure} = \text{Income} $$

> 预算约束：所有**恰好**花光预算的组合。

The **slope** of the budget line: measures the opportunity cost of purchasing/consuming $x$.

**The opportunity cost of purchasing an item depends on**
- The price of the item
- The price of alternative items

**Changes in Budget Line**
- Income changes: parallel shift of budget line.
- Price changes: change one intercept and the slope.
- A proportionate increase in the price of all goods $\iff$ a decrease in income.

> 收入改变，预算线平移；<br>单品价格改变，端点平移（预算线旋转）；<br>价格同比上升$\iff$收入下降。

**Conclusions**
- The highest valued alternative increases in its value, the opportunity cost increases.
- The highest valued alternative decreases in its value, as long as it is still the highest valued alternative, the opportunity cost decreases.
