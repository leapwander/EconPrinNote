# Market Equilibrium

## Part I

`Market Equilibrium` - A situation in which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied.

`Equilibrium price` occurs when $Q^D=Q^S$, and this quantity is called the `equilibrium quantity`.

## Part II

**Disequilibrium**
- `Surplus` - A situation in which quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded, occurs when price is higher than the equilibrium price. 
    > 剩余：$Q^S > Q^D$供大于求，价格高于均衡价格 $\Rightarrow$ 压低价格

    $\Rightarrow$ Some sellers are willing to accept lower prices to sell their inventories.<br>
    $\Rightarrow$ It puts a downward pressure on the price, and eventually brings the market to equilibrium. 

- `Shortage` - A situation in which quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied, occurs when price is lower than the equilibrium price.
    > 短缺：$Q^D > Q^S$求大于供，价格低于均衡价格 $\Rightarrow$ 抬高价格

    $\Rightarrow$ Some buyers are willing to pay more than the prevailing price to ensure that they can get the good. <br>
    $\Rightarrow$ It puts an upward pressure on the price, and eventually brings the market to equilibrium. 

## Part III

**Predict Changes in the Equilibrium Price and Quantity**

`Rule of Thumb`
- Increase $\rightarrow$ Right
- Decrease $\rightarrow$ Left

- **One Side of the Market Changes**
    - **An Increase in Demand**
        - Right shift of the demand curve: P $\uparrow$ & Q $\uparrow$
    - **A Decrease in Demand**
        - Left shift of the demand curve: P $\downarrow$ & Q $\downarrow$
    - **An Increase in Supply**
        - Right shift of the supply curve: P $\downarrow$ & Q $\uparrow$
    - **A Decrease in Supply**
        - Left shift of the supply curve: P $\uparrow$ & Q $\downarrow$
- **Both Sides of the Market Change**
    - It depends on the extent of changes in the curves to determine the direction of the change in the equilibrium price and quantity.
    - **Demands increases and supply increases**: Q $\uparrow$ for sure, P uncertain
    - **Demands increases and supply decreases**: P $\uparrow$ for sure, Q uncertain
    - **Demands decreases and supply increases**: Q $\downarrow$ for sure, P uncertain
    - **Demands decreases and supply decreases**: P $\downarrow$ for sure, Q uncertain
