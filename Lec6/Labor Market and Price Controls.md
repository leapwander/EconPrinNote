`Unemployed Person` - A member of the labor force who does not have a job, but has actively seeking one during the previous 4 weeks.

## Part II

`Price Controls` - Price set and controled by the government.

- `Price Ceiling` - Sets a maximum price that sellers can charge for a good or service.
    - If the price ceilling is set below the equilibrium price, quantity demanded increases and quantity supplied declines, which results in a `shortage`.
    - If the price ceiling is set above the equilibrium price, it has no effect on the market.
    > 上限\>均衡 $\Rightarrow$ 短缺；上限\<均衡 $\Rightarrow$ 无事发生
- `Price Floor` - Requires a minimum price to be paid for a good or service.
    - If the price floor is set above the equilibrium price, quantity supplied increases and quantity demanded declines, which results in a `surplus`.
    - If the price floor is set below the equilibrium price, it has no effect on the market.
    > 下限\>均衡 $\Rightarrow$ 过剩；下限\<均衡 $\Rightarrow$ 无事发生
